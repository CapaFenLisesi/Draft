\maketitle
\abstract{
    A note of Basic Topology, based on \textit{Basic Topology} by M.A.
    Armstrong.
}
\tableofcontents
There are several parts that I will skipped for convenience. Those
include chapter 1 - Introduction, chapter 2 - Continuity, chapter 3 -
Compactness and Connectedness, and chapter 4 - Identification Spaces.
Below is some especially confusing part that I would like to note:

\section{Special Notes}
\label{sec:Special-Notes}
\input{sections/Special-Notes}

\section{A Brief Note of Chapter 4 - Identification Spaces}
\label{sec:Brief-Note-Chapter-4}
\input{sections/Brief-Note-of-Ch-4}

\section{Chapter 5 - Fundamental Groups}
\label{sec:Chapter-5-Fundamental-Groups}
\input{sections/ch5-fundamental-groups.tex}

\textbf{Note:} The teacher decided to temporarily switched to the next
chapter, which is about a technique to patch the whole space. He will
come back to the remaining sections of chapter 5 later.

\section{Chapter 6 - Triangulation}
\label{sec:Chapter6-Triangulation}
\input{sections/ch6-Triangulation}

The teacher jumps right to chapter 8, which introduces an important
tool, the homology groups.

\section{Chapter 8 - Simplicial Homology}
\label{sec:Simplicial-Homology}
\input{sections/ch8-Simplicial-Homology}
