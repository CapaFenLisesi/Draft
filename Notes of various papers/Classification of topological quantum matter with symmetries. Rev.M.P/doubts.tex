\begin{enumerate}
    \item Page 6. Why the scalar in Schur's lemma becomes of unit lenght.
    \item page 9. What does it mean by:
        \begin{quote}
            Note that unitary symmetries, which commute with the
            Hamiltonian, allow us to bring the Hamiltonian into a
            block diagonal form.
        \end{quote}
    \item page 9, table I. When he talks about \textit{codimension},
        what is the dimension of the whole space? ($3$? $3+1$?).
        Similar problem also exists in page 10.
        Note, he mentions codimension of gaples modes on page 11. He
        asserts that codimension $1$ means $1$ dimension less than the
        bulk. But it should be strange to compare the dimension of
        defects with the dimension of the bulk.

        {Online notes about Imperfection}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $0$D (zero dimension) – point defects: vacancies and
                interstitials. Impurities.
            \item 1D – linear defects: dislocations (edge, screw,
                mixed) 
            \item 2D – grain boundaries, surfaces.  
            \item 3D – extended defects: pores, cracks.
        \end{itemize}

        Note: it is finally defined on page 12. that is:
        codimension of defect $d_c:= d_\text{bulk} - d_\text{defect}$.
    \item page 6, what does it mean by saying \textit{"unitary
        symmetry"}.
    \item page 10, what is a \textit{"quantum phase diagram"}.
    \item page 11, what does he says, \textit{"Topological properties of
        adiabatic cycles can also be discussed in a similar manner."}.
        Does this mean that all previous classification does not
        concern the adiabatic cycles? What is \textit{"adiabatic
        cycles"} exactly in his language?
    \item page 12, "disinclination" is what kind of defect? Any books
        on crystall defects?
    \item page 12, is the \textit{"mass gap"} a massive gap or a gap
        composed of mass?
    \item page 12, about the $D$: if $d_c=1$ (line defect in a
        $2d$-bulk), then $D=0$. So a line is wrapped by a point?
        also, on fig. 2, the ($D=2,d=1$) gives a $d_\text{defect}=-1$!
        Judging from this graph, a $d_\text{defect}=-1$ means a
        temporal defect. Is this true?
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Doubts}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item page 10. Amazingly, he says, \textit{"all TIs and TSCs in
        the ten AZ symmetry classes are stable against disorder, and
        hence the assumption of translation invariance is not at all
        necessary"}.  How can translational invariance be ignored?
