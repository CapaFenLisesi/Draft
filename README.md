# Draft
This is intended for storing my drafts of my works. It is messy and will never be organised or documented.

# An Outline of Notes of Drafts Included

1. Complex Geometry - index of ...

    This is intended for keeping a index of notation of the course
    *Introduction to Algebraic Geometry* (which actually teaches
    Complex Geometry) as well as its textbook *Introduction
    to Complex Geometry*.

2. draft.pdf

    This is a general purpose draft. It contains currently:

    * Problems in **Bernevigâ€™s Topological** .... This is a draft for
    my solution to that.

    * Some notes about **superconductors**. Written when I am preparing
    for the *Solid State Theory*'s final exam.
    * Why **0/0** is undefined? My opinion
    * Preface of **BSCS**. My notes about the preface of a book. It is
    very interesting.
    * Some notes on solving systems of **ODE equations**.
    * notes on **Quantum Statistical Mechanics**.

    * The Mathematical Theory of Communication

	    This is **Shannon**'s landmarking paper on Information Theory.
    	I read only a part of it to try to grasp the connotation 
	    of the trendy phrase **information entropy**.

    * Quantum Field Theory

        Notes for the book *The Quantum Theory of Fields* by Weinberg.


3. Useful **(anit)Commutative relationships**

4. **feynman diagram**

	Notes for studying Feynman diagram. Currently stopped at defining
	Green function.

5. Note of Sheaf Theory

    Notes taken to understand sheaf cohomology. (Scattered and
    incomplete.)

6. Algebra
	* Noetherian Ring

		Introduces **Noetherian module** and Noetherian ring. 
		From S.Lang's Algebra.

7. Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell

    Notes for the book *Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell* by A. Zee.

8. **Finished**

    Here in this folder, are notes that are considered finished and are not
    likely to be updated, unless to correct spelling, grammar, etc.

    * **Light Harvesting** Course Note 

        Notes taken when I was attending the course *An Introduction to 
        Light Harvesting in Bacteria and Plants*.

    * Notes of **Lectures on the Frontiers of Physics**, a course
    designed for professors to introduce their own fields.
