@book{Sakurai2011,
abstract = {2nd ed. "This best-selling classic provides a graduate-level, non-historical, modern introduction of quantum mechanical concepts. The author, J.J. Sakurai, was a renowned theorist in particle theory. This revision by Jim Napolitano retains the original material and adds topics that extend the book's usefulness into the 21st century. The introduction of new material, and modification of existing material, appears in a way that better prepares readers for the next course in quantum field theory. Readerse will still find such classic developments as neutron interferometer experiments, Feynman path integrals, correlation measurements, and Bell's inequality."--Pub. desc. Fundamental Concepts -- Quantum Dynamics -- Theory of Angular Momentum -- Symmetry in Quantum Mechanics -- Approximation Methods -- Scattering Theory -- Identical Particles -- Relativistic Quantum Mechanics -- Electromagnetic Units -- Brief Summary of Elementary Solutions to ShroÌˆdinger's Wave Equation -- Proof of the Angular-Momentum Addition Rule Given by Equation (3.8.38).},
