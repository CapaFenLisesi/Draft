# Draft
This is intended for storing my drafts of my works. It is messy and will never be organised or documented.

# An Outline of Notes of Drafts Included

1. **Finished**

    Here in this folder, are notes that are considered finished and are not
    likely to be updated, unless to correct spelling, grammar, etc.

    * **Light Harvesting** Course Note 

        Notes taken when I was attending the course *An Introduction to 
        Light Harvesting in Bacteria and Plants*.

    * Notes of **Lectures on the Frontiers of Physics**, a course
    designed for professors to introduce their own fields.

    * Notes of *Physical Challenges of Quantum Computation*, the
    dissertation of professor MH. Wong. Although I did not finish it,
    I may not read it anymore.

2. Complex Geometry - index of ...

    This is intended for keeping a index of notation of the course
    *Introduction to Algebraic Geometry* (which actually teaches
    Complex Geometry) as well as its textbook *Introduction
    to Complex Geometry*.

    1.1. Complex Geometry - misc

        Here are some miscellaneous things related to the same book.
        For example, my homeworks and some related exercises.

3. draft.pdf

    This is a general purpose draft. It contains currently:

    * Problems in **Bernevigâ€™s Topological** .... This is a draft for
    my solution to that.

    * Some notes about **superconductors**. Written when I am preparing
    for the *Solid State Theory*'s final exam.
    * Why **0/0** is undefined? My opinion
    * Preface of **BSCS**. My notes about the preface of a book. It is
    very interesting.
    * Some notes on solving systems of **ODE equations**.
    * notes on **Quantum Statistical Mechanics**.

    * The Mathematical Theory of Communication

	    This is **Shannon**'s landmarking paper on Information Theory.
    	I read only a part of it to try to grasp the connotation 
	    of the trendy phrase **information entropy**.

    * Quantum Field Theory

        Notes for the book *The Quantum Theory of Fields* by Weinberg.

4. Useful **(anit)Commutative relationships**

5. **feynman diagram**

	Notes for studying Feynman diagram. Currently stopped at defining
	Green function.

6. Note of Sheaf Theory

    Notes taken to understand sheaf cohomology. (Scattered and
    incomplete.)

7. Algebra
	* Noetherian Ring

		Introduces **Noetherian module** and Noetherian ring. 
		From S.Lang's Algebra.

8. Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell (inside *QFT*)

    Notes for the book *Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell* by A. Zee.


9. Quantum Information
    
    Here is the notes of Preskill's **Quantum Computation** course in
    Caltech. It is very ineresting. I focus on the part of quantum
    Information theory.  

10. Group Theory in Physics

    Here is the course taught by Professor Fei Ye, about group theory's
    application in physics. This course, although is targeted at
    graduate level, is quite elemetary from a mathematical perspective.
    However, my notes will contain the occasional sparking intuition
    that I got from Fei Ye's lecture, which is certainly not contained
    in the textbook.

11. Matlab Home
    
    Here stores all sorts of small self-written scripts for Matlab program.

12. Notes for Advanced Quantum Mechanics

    The notes for Advanced Quantum Mechanics, tought by Professor MH. Yong.
    Also due to the level of graduates here, the class is targeted not
    at too high a level.

13. Notes about Bernevig's book 

    Topological Insulators and Superconductors, by Bernevig.

    * Chapter 2 Berry Phase
    * Notes about TR Symmetry (Chapter 4)
    
        This is notes I wrote when I read the third chapter of
        Bernevig's book Introduction to Topological Insulator and
        Superconductors. It also contains a summary of result about
        spins (or in general, Rotations in quantum mechanics), which
        is quite useful for studying other quantum mechanical
        properties.

14. General Physics Formula

    This file stems from my preparation notes for GRE physics test. It
    contains several useful physics formulae, with links to their
    sources.

15. My C.V.

16. Latex Packages

    The packages I write to speed out latex writting.

17. Gravity and Entanglement

    Notes about a lecture. However, this note may not be updated in
    the future.

18. Lattice Green function

    Notes for calculating lattice Green function. However, this not is
    unlikely to be updated in the future.

19. Notes of Connecting Few-body and Many-body Pictures of Fractional
    Quantum Hall Physics

    Notes about a conference named just like above. The detailed
    link can be found inside the note.

20. Notes of Various papers.

21. Useful (anti)Commutative Relationships

22. UltiSnips

    Snippets to speed up typing, using UltiSnips plugin for Vim.

23. Fun facts

    Interesting facts that may or maynot be useful. About physics and
    mathematics.
