# Draft
This is intended for storing my drafts of my works. It is messy and will never be organised or documented.

# An Outline of Notes of Drafts Included

1. Complex Geometry - index of ...

    This is intended for keeping a index of notation of the course
    *Introduction to Algebraic Geometry* (which actually teaches
    Complex Geometry) as well as its textbook *Introduction
    to Complex Geometry*.

    1.1. Complex Geometry - misc

        Here are some miscellaneous things related to the same book.
        For example, my homeworks and some related exercises.

2. draft.pdf

    This is a general purpose draft. It contains currently:

    * Problems in **Bernevigâ€™s Topological** .... This is a draft for
    my solution to that.

    * Some notes about **superconductors**. Written when I am preparing
    for the *Solid State Theory*'s final exam.
    * Why **0/0** is undefined? My opinion
    * Preface of **BSCS**. My notes about the preface of a book. It is
    very interesting.
    * Some notes on solving systems of **ODE equations**.
    * notes on **Quantum Statistical Mechanics**.

    * The Mathematical Theory of Communication

	    This is **Shannon**'s landmarking paper on Information Theory.
    	I read only a part of it to try to grasp the connotation 
	    of the trendy phrase **information entropy**.

    * Quantum Field Theory

        Notes for the book *The Quantum Theory of Fields* by Weinberg.

3. Useful **(anit)Commutative relationships**

4. **feynman diagram**

	Notes for studying Feynman diagram. Currently stopped at defining
	Green function.

5. Note of Sheaf Theory

    Notes taken to understand sheaf cohomology. (Scattered and
    incomplete.)

6. Algebra
	* Noetherian Ring

		Introduces **Noetherian module** and Noetherian ring. 
		From S.Lang's Algebra.

7. Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell

    Notes for the book *Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell* by A. Zee.

8. **Finished**

    Here in this folder, are notes that are considered finished and are not
    likely to be updated, unless to correct spelling, grammar, etc.

    * **Light Harvesting** Course Note 

        Notes taken when I was attending the course *An Introduction to 
        Light Harvesting in Bacteria and Plants*.

    * Notes of **Lectures on the Frontiers of Physics**, a course
    designed for professors to introduce their own fields.

    * Notes of *Physical Challenges of Quantum Computation*, the
    dissertation of professor MH. Wong. Although I did not finish it,
    I may not read it anymore.

9. Quantum Information
    
    Here is the notes of Preskill's **Quantum Computation** course in
    Caltech. It is very ineresting. I focus on the part of quantum
    Information theory.  

10. Group Theory in Physics

    Here is the course taught by Professor Fei Ye, about group theory's
    application in physics. This course, although is targeted at
    graduate level, is quite elemetary from a mathematical perspective.
    However, my notes will contain the occasional sparking intuition
    that I got from Fei Ye's lecture, which is certainly not contained
    in the textbook.

11. Matlab Home
    
    Here stores all sorts of small self-written scripts for Matlab program.
